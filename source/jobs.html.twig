                        <h2>tl;dr</h2>
                        <p>JIRA, Freshdesk, Slack, PhpStorm, PHP 7+, Laravel, Symfony, Phalcon, MySQL, Postgres,
                            git, github, bitbucket, bootstrap, sass, SMACSS, vuejs, jquery,

                        <h2>hours</h2>
                        <p>
                            Our preferred way to work with clients is billing per hour.<br>
                            It means we log all our activities in JIRA. Logging only happens when we're actually
                            working with something, so it's expected to have 6 hours logged per day (with full time (8
                            hours) contract).<br>
                            <em>(training, learning, meetings, fixing your laptop counts - lunch, smoking, hanging
                                around doesn't).</em>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Normal business hours are 9:00 - 17:00 EET, but <strong>hours are flexible</strong>.<br>
                            <strong>Overtime is generally discouraged</strong> - but can happen before deadlines.<br>
                            Personal and timezone preferences are appreciated.
                        </p>

                        <h2>holiday</h2>
                        <p>
                            Any of us takes <strong>30-40 days off per year</strong> (besides national holidays).<br>
                            Yes, they're paid and <strong>that's the double</strong> compared to what you get elsewhere.
                        </p>

                        <h2>location</h2>
                        <p>
                            Currently we operate in Transylvania, Romania in 2 locations: Cluj and Sfantu Gheorghe (next
                            to Brasov).<br>
                            We can also provide with an office in Budapest and beginning from 2018 in Berlin.<br>
                            You can pick any of these locations and decide to move between them.<br>
                            <strong>Remote work is completely OK</strong>, regardless of your time zone.
                        </p>

                        <h2>salary</h2>
                        <p>
                            The money you'll earn depends on your knowledge level, location and on whether it's
                            employment or contractual collaboration. It can be full time, part-time or hours based
                            payment.<br>
                            Every penny is paid in a legal manner, incl. state taxes, contributions.<br>
                            If you're keen to learn and develop, your salary will constantly raise.<br>
                            Fresh juniors usually double their salary in the first 12 months.<br>
                            You can also get help from us to buy the things you wish.
                        </p>

                        <h2>language</h2>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Default language is English</strong>.<br>
                            We also speak: Hungarian, Romanian, German (and one of us can read Dutch 😉).<br>
                            Worklogs, code commenting and documentation must be in English.<br>
                            Client communication usually happens in their native language.<br>
                            For internal communication <em>use whatever you want</em>.
                        </p>

                        <h2>culture</h2>
                        <p>
                            We like clean code, dirty jokes, biking, coffee, beer, hamburgers, apples, rucola, smelly
                            cheese and mountains.<br>
                            We don't support fish pizza, corruption, soldiers, bullshit, Windows,
                            A Prime Minister and flat land.
                        </p>

                        <h2>tech drama</h2>
                        <p>
                            <strong>So we</strong> went after what people said, and picked Magento.<br>
                            We've <strong>suffered a lot from</strong> needless complexity.<br><br>
                            So we've went <strong>hacky</strong>; picked Wordpress and &bdquo;handmade&ldquo; code.<br>
                            We've suffered a lot from <strong>spaghetti</strong> code <strong>and irresponsible</strong>
                            developers.<br><br>
                            So we've went after books; picked <strong>DDD</strong>, TDD, BDD, SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP,
                            DIP.<br>
                            We've suffered a lot from applying principles turned out to be
                            <strong>dogmas</strong>.<br><br>
                            So now we're going simple and organized. Let's see what happens.
