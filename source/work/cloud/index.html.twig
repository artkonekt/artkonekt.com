                        <p>Some companies still run their servers <b>on premises</b>, even if their size
                        and the type of usage doesn't justify it. Many other companies already use
                            <b>Virtual Servers</b>, but nothing else from the wide range of Cloud
                            tooling.</p>
                        <p>Mostly they are aware that they should've moved already, and
                            the reason they're staying with their legacy IT Infrastructure is
                        that the risk seems too big.</p>

                        <h2>Frequent Difficulties with Cloud Migration</h2>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Incompatibility (technical or licensing)</li>
                            <li>Lack of Business Objectives</li>
                            <li>Worry about costs</li>
                            <li>Lack of expertise</li>
                            <li>Internal resistance</li>
                            <li>Data security concerns</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>In many cases companies already have a business use-case, are armed with
                            a strong management and technical staff. In fact, they have almost
                            everything that makes them capable of moving to the cloud.</p>
                        <p>What's often missing is someone with a <b>battlefield cloud experience</b>
                            that can help guiding the company during their move.
                        </p>

                        <h2>How To Overcome Cloud Migration Difficulties</h2>

                        <p>What we often do to support such operations, is to take over one or more of
                            the following responsibilities:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Trainings and Workshops</li>
                            <li>Technical and Financial Assessment</li>
                            <li>Being part of decision making, developing the strategy</li>
                            <li>Doing the actual work</li>
                            <li>Writing guides for engineers</li>
                            <li>Suggest concrete solutions</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Benefits</h2>

                        <p>Other than the expected and planned benefits, moving to the cloud often
                        brings the following "unexpected" improvements to the table:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Stability increases significantly</li>
                            <li>The system becomes more transparent &rarr; less surprises</li>
                            <li>Teams become pro-active instead of reactive</li>
                            <li>Customers' trust gains, as they see much less problems</li>
                            <li>Scalability becomes predictable and not a source of fear</li>
                            <li>Migration turns out to be much less problematic than expected</li>
                        </ul>
