                        <p>Currently we have active projects with:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>PHP 7.0 - 7.4 üêò</li>

                        <p>

                            So you won't see fat controllers or god objects. We have to admit fat
                            services are still alive in some of our older codebases. We're having
                            flirts with CQRS for a while and lately also with Event Sourcing.

                        Yes, we've been hacked already. And had to write a post-mortem report to a Police
                        Investigator once.

                        That's why we use:

                        <ul>
                            <li>Cloudflare</li>
                            <li>Nexpose</li>
                            <li>Rigid non-access policy on servers</li>
                            <li>Key based authentication if possible</li>
                            <li>Double encrypted password store</li>
                        </ul>

                        It's worth to mention that <strong>we're not security experts</strong>. We've found that's a
                        separate profession.

                            We usually don't take fixed price projects, but prefer long term,
                            permanent relationships.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The reasons why we're concerned:
                        </p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>At the beginning of the project none of the parties exactly know what they're about to
                                build.
                            </li>
                            <li>Parties often think they do know, but they actually don't.</li>
                            <li>Repeat: at the beginning there are many factors unknown for either of the parties.</li>
                            <li>If we jump on the train of <em>very-very detailed specs</em>, it
                                takes an extended period and it is still unable to predict the future.
                            </li>
                            <li>If we overestimate, the client pays more than it costs.</li>
                            <li>If we underestimate, we loose money.</li>
                            <li>If the client pays more, they try to squeeze out more than that was in the agreement.
                            </li>
                            <li>If we loose money, we'll try to minimize further loss by chopping off
                                features/quality.
                            </li>
                            <li>Any of these scenarios results either a win-loose or a loose-loose situation.</li>
                            <li>This also leads to shameful negotiations.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>
                            What we've seen to work very well during the years and proved to be very
                            efficient is to work very close together as we were part of the internal
                            team. Most successful projects we've participated worked this way.
                        </p>

                        <p>We are more than open to discuss your next project idea, and provide
                            with an insight of what to expect, an estimated timeline, possible
                            obstacles and solutions.</p>

                        <h2 id="pricing">Pricing</h2>
                        <p>
                            Our preferred way to work is <strong>billing per hour</strong>.<br><br>
                            It means we log all our activities in JIRA. Logging only happens when we're actually
                            working with something, so it's expected to have ~6 hours/person/day (with a full time
                            contract).
                        </p>

                        <p>At the end of the month you'll receive a detailed Time Report that contains all the work done
                            and the number of hours spent with them. We don't do rounding, so 30 minutes of work is
                            always 0.5 hours</p>

                        <h2>Team</h2>
                        <p>
                            Our team currently consists of 4 people.

                        <p>
                            Normal business hours are 9:00 - 17:00 EET.<br>
                            Live systems are being monitored and recovered on failure <strong>24/7/365</strong>.<br>
                            We operate a <strong>helpdesk</strong> for projects in the operation/maintenance phase.<br><br>
                            We can provide with services beyond business hours/days on demand.<br>
                        </p>

                        <h2 id="agile">Agile?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Apart from being a buzzword, Scrum can work pretty well in some scenarios.<br>
                            We can do <strong>Scrum</strong> if necessary, but we don't stick to it.<br><br>
                            We've done dozens of sprints already with all those scrummy goodies like planning poker (fun),
                            burndown charts (never worked), retrospectives ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø.<br>
                            If the decision is up to us, we choose a workflow that's near to <strong>Kanban</strong>,
                            with rapid 1-2 weeks iteration + continuous delivery.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There's one thing we encourage as much as possible, and that's a clean agreement on:<br>
                            - who can submit requests,<br>
                            - what are the expected results,<br>
                            - who/when approves completed work,<br>
                            - complaint resolution paths.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Our default work language is English</strong>.<br>
                            We also speak: Hungarian, Romanian, German (and one of us can read Dutch üòâ).<br>
                            We create worklogs, code comments and documentation in English.
