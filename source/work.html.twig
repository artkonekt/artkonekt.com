                            We pretty much cover the <a href="https://codeup.com/what-is-a-full-stack-developer/"

                            However if we must highlight our most powerful areas, they're <em>PHP Backend
                                development</em>
                            and simple but scalable <em>Cloud Infrastructure</em>.

                        <p>Currently we have active projects with:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>PHP 7.0, 7.1, 7.2 üêò</li>
                            <li>Symfony 2/3/4</li>
                            <li>Laravel 5.3 - 5.5</li>
                            <li>Sylius 0.14, 0.17</li>
                            <li>Phalcon 2, 3</li>
                            <li>Wordpress</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>We use these technologies to create websites/applications, REST APIs, CLI apps, background
                            jobs. <br><br>
                            Formerly we also used to work with:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Yii 1,2</li>
                            <li>Magento 1 üôä</li>
                            <li>Zend Framework 2</li>
                            <li>Konekt Framework 1, 2 (our own MVC ü§¶)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Architechture</h4>

                        <p>
                            Our typical solution can be probably the best described as <a
                                    href="http://fideloper.com/hexagonal-architecture" target="_blank">Hexagonal
                                Architecture</a> + Domain Events.<br><br>
                            So you won't see fat controllers or god objects. Fat services, yes that could happen.
                            Neither have we stepped to CQRS yet, nor to Event Sourcing, but we're already having flirts.

                        Yes, we've been hacked already. And had to write a post-mortem report to a Police
                        Investigator once.

                        That's why we use:

                        <ul>
                            <li>Cloudflare</li>
                            <li>Nexpose</li>
                            <li>Rigid non-access policy on servers</li>
                            <li>Key based authentication if possible</li>
                            <li>Double encrypted password store</li>
                        </ul>

                        It's worth to mention that <strong>we're not security experts</strong>. We've found that's a
                        separate profession.

                            That might sound odd, but here are the reasons why:
                        </p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>At the beginning of the project none of the parties exactly know what they're about to
                                build.
                            </li>
                            <li>Clients often think they do know, but they actually don't.</li>
                            <li>Repeat: at the beginning there are many factors unknown for either of the parties.</li>
                            <li>If we jump on the train of <em>very-very detailed specs</em>, the client usually gets
                                pissed off.
                            </li>
                            <li>If we overestimate, the client pays more than it costs.</li>
                            <li>If we underestimate, we loose money.</li>
                            <li>If the client pays more, they try to squeeze out more than that was in the agreement.
                            </li>
                            <li>If we loose money, we'll try to minimize further loss by chopping off
                                features/quality.
                            </li>
                            <li>Any of these scenarios results either a win-loose or a loose-loose situation.</li>
                            <li>This also leads to shameful negotiations.</li>
                        </ol>

                        </p>

                        <p>We are, however more than open to discuss your next project idea, and provide with an
                            insight of what to expect, an estimated timeline, possible obstacles.</p>

                        <h2 id="pricing">Pricing</h2>
                        <p>
                            Our preferred way to work with clients is <strong>billing per hour</strong>.<br><br>
                            It means we log all our activities in JIRA. Logging only happens when we're actually
                            working with something, so it's expected to have ~6 hours/person/day (with a full time
                            contract).
                        </p>

                        <p>At the end of the month you'll receive a detailed Time Report that contains all the work done
                            and the number of hours spent with them. We don't do rounding, so 30 minutes of work is
                            always 0.5 hours</p>

                        <h4>Fees</h4>
                        <p>
                            Our fee is <strong>35‚Ç¨/hour</strong> for Software Development, Design &amp; Consulting.

                        <p>
                            Normal business hours are 9:00 - 17:00 EET.<br>

                            We operate a <strong>helpdesk</strong> for projects in the operation/maintenance phase.<br><br>
                            We can provide with services beyond business hours/days on demand.<br>

                        <h2 id="agile">Agile?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Apart from being a buzzword, Scrum can work pretty well in some scenarios.<br>
                            We can do <strong>Scrum</strong> if necessary, but we don't stick to it.<br><br>
                            If the decision is up to us, we choose a workflow that's near to <strong>Kanban</strong>,
                            with rapid 1-2 weeks of planning and continuous delivery.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There's one thing we encourage as much as possible, and that's a clean agreement on:<br>
                            - who can submit requests,<br>
                            - what are the expected results,<br>
                            - who/when approves completed work,<br>
                            - complaint resolution paths.
